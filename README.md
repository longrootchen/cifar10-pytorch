# Re-implementation of ConvNets on CIFAR-10 with PyTorch

## Introduction

Here are some re-implementations of Convolutional Networks on CIFAR-10 dataset.

Note that, in the paper by He et al.[1], the training set that consists of 50k training images was divided into 45k/5k train/val split. So I first made stratefied 10-fold split. The implement details are as in [this repository](https://github.com/longrootchen/stratefied-10-fold-cifar10).

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+

- PyTorch 1.0+

## Usage

1. Clone this repository

        git clone https://github.com/longrootchen/cifar10-pytorch.git

2. Train a model, taking resnet20 as an example

        python -u train.py --work-dir ./experiments/resnet20
        
3. Evaluate a model, taking resnet20 as an example

        python -u eval.py --arch resnet20 --num-classes 10 --ckpt-path ./experiments/resnet20/checkpoints/last_checkpoint.pth --gpu cuda:0 --df-path ./datasets/test.csv --img-dir ./datasets/test
